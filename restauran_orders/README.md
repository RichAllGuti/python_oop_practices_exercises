# This markdown file is created to describe the example and for detail how it will be developed.

## The restaurant order system is to provide a digital solution to the waiters who work in the restaurant.

<br>

### To organize the code I'll put each class in a separate file.

**Here's the overview of the files I'll create:**

1. The menu_item file which will contains the MenuItem base class and its subclasses.

2. The order file will contains the Order class.

3. The table file contains the Table class.
